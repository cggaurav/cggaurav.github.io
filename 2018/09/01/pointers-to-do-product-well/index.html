    <h1 id="13pointersifyouareinaproductrole">13 Pointers if you are in a Product Role</h1>

<p>As I often find myself in the intersection of tech &amp; product for fast growing startups that are trying to find product market fit, these pointers have helped me to work effectively to figure out next steps for the product. #productnotes</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>The “Product’ role is relatively new and there are no clear definitions for it as it often varies across companies. Interestingly it started off from a marketing role and then has moved to a place where the role often sites between <br>
different <strong>stakeholders</strong> of a company be it tech (UX/UI), sales, business, customer support/user research including marketing.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4rqZJs_MrLFVjmtWtzKvwA.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="letsgo">Lets go</h3>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> To have a successful product, the idea is to keep asking <em>*WHY *</em>keeping
the end user in mind. If the repeated whys are not answered clearly, the <br>
underlying assumptions need to be revisited.</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Software engineers build and fix bugs in the product and need their mind
time utilized effectively for just that. The role of product is keeping the line <br>
from end users to engineers short, effective and two way, getting all <br>
distractions out of the way.</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Building a good product is often full of distractions, more prone to
failure than you expect and can get easily complex. Keep things as <strong>simple</strong> as <br>
possible (KISS), and <strong>prioritize</strong> ruthlessly.</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong> To reduce complexity, a product is often dividied into smaller
products/features like by</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform: iOS vs Android vs Web</li>
<li>Feature: Recommendations on Netflix, Search on Spotify, Messenger on FB, Moments
on Twitter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(6) Define your Metrics</strong></p>

<p><strong>KPI</strong> or Key Performance Indicators define if the product is going in the
right direction. KPIs bring teams together and its important to define them <br>
<em>well</em>. Common ones are</p>

<p>MAU/DAU = Monthly active users, daily active users.</p>

<p>MRR = Monthly recurring revenue.</p>

<p><strong>(7)</strong> You don’t need to be the IDEA person to figure out how to solve all
product problems. As long as every major decision comes from a deep desire to <br>
get closer to the truth to find product market fit, you are avoiding major pit <br>
falls.</p>

<p>Where do ideas come from? <em>Employees, Metrics, Users</em></p>

<p><strong>(8) Technical Knowledge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AB Testing (Optimizely)</li>
<li>Core principles for UI/UX design to not reinvent wheels.</li>
<li>Analytics (Google, Kissmetrics) and how to track actions.</li>
<li>Prototyping using Proto/Balsamiq</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(9) Product lifecycle</strong></p>

<p>Be aware of which stage a product or feature is in.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Conception of Feature after Ideation/Brainstorming</em></li>
<li><em>Project Planning</em></li>
<li><em>Developing Software</em></li>
<li><em>Iterate</em> (Test feedback)</li>
<li><em>Launch</em></li>
<li><em>Iterate + Steady state (</em>OR<em>) Fail</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(10) How do we develop the product?</strong></p>

<p>Minimum viable product (MVP), Lean Startup by Eric Ries talk enough about to keep product development effective.</p>

<p>From a software point of view, development is “Agile”, and there are two schools of thought.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SCRUM</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Tickets created are units of work assigned to a developer.</p>

<p>Sprint. Generally two weeks.</p>

<p>Sprint planning moves tickets from product to sprint backlog.</p>

<p>Daily &lt;15m stand up meetings with (Now, Blockers, Next)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>KANBAN</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Not as strict as Scrum, more “relaxed”. Harder to “estimate” work.</p>

<p>Kanban Board. Has only three columns. TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE.</p>

<p>No sprints. Only “product” backlog, which is endless.</p>

<p>No specific meeting types.</p>

<p>Only a certain number of tickets that are in progress.</p>

<p><strong>(11) Set up an effective COMMUNICATION architecture.</strong></p>

<p>People fuck up all the time, so keep the atmosphere positive, less blame games, <br>
give credit when its due and keep customer satisfaction as your light at the end <br>
of the tunnel. This can happen irrespective of what personality type you fit <br>
into.</p>

<p>With communication, focus on the what (given whys are answered) over the hows.</p>

<p>What works</p>

<ol>
<li><em>1–1 meetings.</em> How are things going?  </li>
<li>*Retrospectives from sprints. *What have we done the last two weeks? How can we <br>
do better the next two weeks?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(12) Common Cognitive Biases</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Halo</strong> and <strong>Horns</strong> effect. Causes you to allow one reason/one advantage, <br>
either good (halo) or bad (horns), to overshadow other reasons. Eg: Good looking <br>
people thought to be intelligent.  </li>
<li><strong>Availability bias</strong>. We tend to remember frequent &amp; recent events and use that <br>
for reasoning even though they might not be supportive (enough)  </li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong>. Classic. We tend to rationalize and put more resources to <br>
a project that is failing hoping to see the tables turn. Often why pivot <br>
decisions take longer and feel hard to make.  </li>
<li><strong>Boredom syndrome</strong>. Most (ambitious) humans have the tendency to need to act, <br>
even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even <br>
when we do not enough knowledge to solve the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Influence of stress</strong>. Biases become more prominent when stressed. Hasty <br>
decisions.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(13) Conduct User interviews</strong></p>

<p>Often under worked on, but talking to end users defines where the product needs <br>
to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask for feedback often and go after different profiles of end users.</li>
<li>Have a clear list of questions to ask them and keep this open with WHAT and HOW
questions. Informal however.  </li>
<li>Don’t reveal what you are working on. Its important that they trip on it and
this is possible because its a “problem” they have. This is the AHA moment you <br>
have to lead them into.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above pointers may or may not work you since each product/team is <br>
different.</p>
